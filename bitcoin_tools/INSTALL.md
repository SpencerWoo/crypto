# Installation

Download / clone the repository and add it as a Python repository by:

- Placing it under the Python's lib folder (by default under `/usr/lib/python2.7/` for Linux systems and 
`/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/` for OS X). (e.g `mv bitcoin_tools/bitcoin_tools /usr/lib/python2.7/`)

or

- Including the library folder path in the Python's path by running 
`PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path_to_the_code/bitcoin_tools`.

or

- Using the library as a `PyCharm project`.

Copy / rename `sample_conf.py` to `conf.py` and configure it using your own data (some hints are included in 
the file).

Create a directory that matches `bitcoin_tools_dir` on you `conf.py` (Notice that this is a user data directory, where
the data generated by the library will be read / written, not the path to the code itself).

Install all the dependencies (check the [dependencies section](DEPENDENCIES.md)).
